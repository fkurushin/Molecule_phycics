# Quick information about package

Created while listening Molecular Dynamics course in NRNU MEPHI.
Possibilities of this packages:
* Van der Waals volume calculating(need to be fixed, because of new structure)
* Interaction energy
* Molecule structure relaxation using gradient descent algorithms
* Verle method to imitate atomic fluctuations
* Learning dependence of temperature and volume(need to be fixed, because of new structure)
* Thermal resistance
* Learning tensile properties (multiprocessing)
* Thermal conductivity tests (multiprocessing)
* Building a calorimetry curve (multiprocessing)
* Molecular spectrum obtained with second derivative
* Molecular spectrum obtained with autocorrelation function
